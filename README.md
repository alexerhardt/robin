# robin - A lightweight CSS framework

Light CSS framework made as the final project for Harvard Extension School's DGMD E-27, *Modern and Mobile Front-End Design*. The assignment was to build a CSS framework in Sass, with a fully responsive grid and a choice of styling components (ie, cards, buttons, etc.), and finally to document everything.

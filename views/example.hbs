            <p>
                Fred may appear flashy and feisty when you first meet
                him, but don't let appearances fool you. These
                bright pink feathers hide a being with an honest and
                introspective personality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though Fred works in finance, he spends much of his time
                thinking about the flight of flamingos. When did they
                lose this precious ability? Can Darwin explain this?
                Can anyone?
            </p>
            <p>
                These meditations have not made Frank lose his joie de vivre,
                however. If you know him, it's probably because you've met
                him at one of the fulgurant parties he so often organizes.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you haven't met him yet, then what are you waiting to join
                one of his fÃªtes? They are always open house. Feathered or
                featherless, you will be welcome!
